# StayPointDetection
Function: Extract stay points from a GPS log file and display them in a map generated by folium.  
  
Usage:  
`python3 stayPointDetection_basic.py`  
`python3 stayPointDetection_density.py`    

There are two versions of stay point detection algorithm: stayPointDetection_basic.py and stayPointDetection_density.py, both described in the overview [1].  

We use Geolife Trajectories 1.3 public datasets as test data.  

Full test data could be downloaded from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=52367  

`stayPointDetection_basic.py` : Implementation of algorithm in [2], having some boundaries modified to get more accurate results.
